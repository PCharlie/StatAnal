## Drawing from a **lognormal distribution**
We draw 100 numbers using the function _rlnorm()_.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
x <- rlnorm(1:100, mean=0, sd=0.25)
```

#### Checking whether x approximates the correct distribution
We do so by making a histogram by using the function _hist_.
To correct for the log-distribution, we use a scaled x-axis.

```{}
hist(x, freq=FALSE, log="x")
```



#### Calculating the mean and standard deviation
The mean is simply calculated by the function _mean()_ and the sd by the function _sd()_.

```{r pressure}
mean <- mean(x)
sd <- sd(x)
print(mean)
print(sd)
```

mean = 1.03
sd = 0.22
These are not exactly equal to the actual mean and sd.
The higher the amount of drawn points gets, the better the approximation is.
