## Drawing an _incredible_ load of numbers from a **pretty weird** distribution
We draw all numbers using the function _dnorm()_ and we do this 100 times.
To make sure we draw from a lognormal distribution, we add the variable _log=TRUE_ as an argument.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
x <- rlnorm(1:100, mean=0, sd=0.25)
```

#### Checking whether x approximates the correct distribution
We do so by making a histogram by using the function _hist_.


```{}
hi <- hist(log(x), freq=FALSE)
```



#### Calculating the mean and standard deviation
The mean is simply calculated by the function _mean()_ and the sd by the function _sd()_.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
mean <- mean(x)
sd <- sd(x)
```

mean = 1.03
sd = 0.22
These are not exactly equal to the actual mean and sd.
The higher the amount of drawn points gets, the better the epproximation is.
